# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Prediction App

## 🔗 Link Streamlit

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **Customer Churn Prediction Web Application** built using Machine Learning and deployed with Streamlit. The application predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on service usage, contract type, and payment behavior.

The prediction model uses **XGBoost** and handles class imbalance using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**.
